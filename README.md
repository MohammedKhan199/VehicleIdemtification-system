# VehicleIdentification-system
In this project I created a HashTable of 7000 entries. Those entries included information about the vehicle and owner. The information is displayed using JAVA GUI representation.
It takes approximately 1 second to display all the 7000 entries and takes 6 seconds to add 2 million entries.
